# knight-tour-warnsdroff
This is an implementation of knight's tour problem using warnsdroff's rule.

Several snapshots of the algorithm is available in the *snapshots* directory.

For the **neural networks solution of knight's tour** please visit https://github.com/NiloofarShahbaz/knight-tour-neural-network.

This implementation does not necessarily find closed tour.

## Usage

I have used **pygame** for algorithm visualization. install the requirements and run *main.py*.

if you don't want the GUI you can uncomment the last 2 lines of *knight_tour.py* and then run that.
